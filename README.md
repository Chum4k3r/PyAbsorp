# PyAbsorp
This is a package developed to be use to find the _Sound Absorption Coefficient_ through some implemented models, like  _Biot-Allard_, _Johnson-Champoux_ and others.

## Dependencies
**PyAbsorp** runs under Linux, Windows and MacOS, a **Python 3.8.2** installation is needed with the latest **Numpy**, **Scipy**. 
_Matplotlib is recommended, but not necessary._

## Implemented Models
- **Delany-Bazley** (with **Miki** and **Allard-Champoux** variation)
- **Biot-Allard**
- **Johnson-Champoux** (with **Allard** and **Lafarge** variation)
- **Rayleigh**

## Future Objectives
- [ ] Code validation
- [ ] Implement Pride variation to the Johnson-Champoux model.
- [ ] Implement models to the perforated plates situation.
- [ ] Theoretical review of the implemented models.
- [ ] English review
